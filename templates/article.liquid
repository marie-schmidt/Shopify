{% comment %}
  Comments will not appear right after they are submitted, either to be checked for spam
  or to await moderation. When a comment is submitted, the browser is redirected to a page
  that includes the new comment id in its URL.
    Example: http://shopname.myshopify.com/blogs/news/2022072-my-post?comment=3721372
{% endcomment %}

{%- assign number_of_comments = article.comments_count -%}

{% comment %}
  If a comment was just submitted and it has no blank fields, we have an extra comment to count.
{% endcomment %}
{% if comment and comment.created_at %}
  {%- assign number_of_comments = article.comments_count | plus: 1 -%}
{% endif %}
